<center><h1 id="Frame3">Nested Iframes</h1>
<iframe src="iframe1.html" width="800" height="600"></iframe></center>
<h3><i>Nested iframes refer to an iframe element placed inside another iframe, creating a hierarchy where one webpage is embedded within another, and that embedded page contains an additional iframe. This setup allows for complex content layering, such as loading a main site that contains a widget or tool, which itself embeds a separate application or external content. Nested iframes are commonly used in scenarios like advertisement delivery systems, embedded analytics dashboards, or secure environments where content needs to be isolated in layers.

However, working with nested iframes comes with certain challenges. Due to browser security measures, especially the Same-Origin Policy, accessing or manipulating content between nested frames is restricted unless all frames originate from the same domain. If they come from different domains, cross-origin communication must be handled using secure methods like the postMessage() API. Additionally, deep nesting can lead to slower page load times, layout complications, and difficulties in debugging or managing CSS and JavaScript interactions across frames.

From a usability perspective, each iframe introduces its own scrollbars and focus contexts, which can affect the user experience. Developers should use nested iframes carefully, ensuring they are necessary and properly managed to maintain performance, security, and accessibility standards on the webpage.</i></h3>
